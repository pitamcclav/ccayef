                    Child Care And Youth Empowerment Foundation (CCAYEF) is a non-profit charitable organization that was established in 2008.  
                   
                    The organization was founded by a three of individuals who were passionate about the welfare of children and young people in Uganda being nurtured holistically to 
                    realize their full growth and development potential.
                    The founders of CCAYEF recognized the need to provide support and resources to children and young people who were vulnerable and marginalized.
                    The organization was established with the aim of empowering children and young people to reach their full potential and lead healthy and fulfilling lives.
                    Since its establishment, CCAYEF has been working to provide early childhood development through education, healthcare service, and other essential services to 
                    children and young people in Uganda.
                    The organization has also been working to raise awareness about the rights of children and young people and to advocate for their rights including Gender Based Violence.
                    CCAYEF is committed to making a positive impact in the lives of children and young people in Uganda and to creating a better future for them.
                    The organization is registered by Uganda Ministry of Internal Affairs – NGO Board <b>(Reg No: 4164, CCAYEF. S. 5914/9236)</b>
